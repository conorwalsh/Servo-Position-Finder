# servo-position-finder
This code was created as a piece of testing software that I used to determine positions for a servo motor connected to an Arduino where the servo needed to be positioned very precisely.

I originally wrote this software as part of an award winning project that I presented at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition 2014 (Ireland).
